# A guide to ExpansionHunter Denovo software

ExpansionHunter Denovo (EHdn) is a suite of tools for detecting novel expansions
of short tandem repeats (STRs). EHdn is intended for analysis of a collection of
BAM/CRAM files containing alignments of short (100-200bp) reads.

To use ExpansionHunter Denovo you need to (1) download the latest release or build
the program from source, (2) obtain a collection of BAM/CRAM files a subset of which
is suspected to contain a repeat expansion.
